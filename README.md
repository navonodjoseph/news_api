# news_api
A basic news website created with react powered by nyt api 

Sunday (feb 11). I'm learning how to use APIs in my software engineering class. I'm going to experiment with New York Times' dev tools to see if I can build out a UI that is powered by NYT APIs. 
I expect to provide my in-depth documentation by end of week.
