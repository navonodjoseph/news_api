# news_api
A basic news app created with JavaScript, React, and the New York Times 'Most Popular' API.  

## Description 
A news app that populates with the 'most popular' stories on nytimes.com. The website automatically updates to reflect most popular. This website filters from a large dataset to present the top 6 stories online right now. It also includes a hamburger menu which gives the app more of a news website feel and could allow for additional API features down the road. 

## Getting started
I'm now midway through my Software Engineering course at General Assembly, and I wanted to work with an API that was both large and constantly updating. I choose the New York Times' API because it fullfills both of these requirements. It's also well-documented and has other API features like "search" and rss feeds that I'm interested in eventually adding.
